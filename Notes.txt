Dependencies two types of Dependencies are there:
        1. dev Dependencies - required in development
        2. normal Dependencies

so to install dev Dependencieswe need a command on terminal which is 
npm install -D parcel

the node modules installed contain all the code/ data of the Dependency
transitive Dependencies are Dependencies installed when we try to install 
the parcel.
We need to install a Dependency parcel and parcel has its other Dependencies
and these have other and many more hence it is termed as transitive 
Dependencies...


the mighty json******


** every Dependency in node modules has its own package.json folder **

we need not to put this node modules to github so we will put it in 
.gitinore file
but it is not the case for package and packagelock.json

if i have package and packagelock.json i can recreate all my modules


<<<<<<******8npm vs npx *****>>>>

npx means executing the package...
when we need to install the package we use npm, used to install,update 
the packages of js 



---> to install the react dom you can write 
npm install react-dom or npm i react-development
now you have both react and react-dom installed in your system so you can remove the cdn linkes from the index.html file
